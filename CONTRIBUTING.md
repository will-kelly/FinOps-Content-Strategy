# Contributing to the Enterprise FinOps Content Repository

Thank you for helping build and maintain our Cloud FinOps content strategy.  
This guide explains how to contribute new content, update existing files, and keep everything consistent across the enterprise.

---

## 📝 Content Principles
- **Clarity first**: Use plain language (avoid jargon unless necessary).  
- **Consistency**: Follow existing templates for briefs, playbooks, and success stories.  
- **Reusability**: Write content so it can be easily adapted across business units.  
- **Evidence-based**: Use real data, metrics, or lessons learned wherever possible.

## 🚀 How to Contribute
1. **Start from a template**  
   - Use `executive-brief-template.md`, `practitioner-playbook-template.md`, or `success-story-template.md`.  
   - Copy the template into a new file. Name it clearly (e.g., `executive-brief-governance.md`).  

2. **Follow formatting rules**  
   - Use Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) consistently.  
   - Keep sentences short and direct.  
   - Numbers: write as numerals (e.g., 5, not five):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
   - Acronyms: spell out first use, then use acronym:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  

3. **Submit changes**  
   - Open a pull request with a clear description:  
     - Purpose of the content  
     - Target audience  
     - Any metrics or data included  
   - Tag the **FinOps Enablement Lead** for review.  

4. **Review process**  
   - Content reviewed by SMEs (subject matter experts) for accuracy.  
   - Final check by Content Strategy Office for tone, clarity, and style.  
   - Approved content merged into `main`.

## ✅ Do’s and Don’ts
**Do**  
- Write in plain, accessible language:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
- Use data and real examples when possible.  
- Keep content modular and easy to repurpose.  

**Don’t**  
- Overuse buzzwords like “synergy” or “delight the user”:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  
- Write walls of text — use subheadings and lists where clarity improves.  
- Publish without following templates and review workflow.  

---

## 📊 Content Metrics
Every new contribution should include:  
- Intended **audience** (Executive, Practitioner, Enablement).  
- Expected **outcomes** (e.g., reduce unused resources by 10%).  
- How it can be **reused** across teams (e.g., newsletter snippet, training deck).

## 🔑 Final Note
